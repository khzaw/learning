* React
** PureComponent
  - ~PureComponent~ is a like a regular ~Component~ with one difference: it implements ~shouldComponentUpdate~. Does a *shallow* prop and state comparison.


* Org-mode
- Source code can be included within =-#+BEGIN_SRC <insert_lang> #+END_SRC-=
- Looks like you can even use their native language major-mode within these snippet blocks. Very powerful.
